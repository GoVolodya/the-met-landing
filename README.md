## Technologies Used

### 1. HTML
The landing page's structure is built using HTML, providing the fundamental markup that defines the layout and content
of the page.

### 2. SCSS
Styling for the landing page is done using SCSS, a CSS preprocessor that allows for more efficient and powerful styling
through features like variables, nesting, and mixins.

### 3. BEM
